4. Next, create a file named `.env`, add the following to it, replacing the values with your API keys (no quotes) once you have them:

```js
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=d0cc6c55fd6e4b08884a8a656d3d944f
SPOTIFY_SECRET=9856ee46875a422ab43b5483ab221e81


* This file will be used by the `dotenv` package 
to set what are known as environment variables to the global 
`process.env` object in node. These are values that are meant 
to be specific to the computer that node is running on, and since 
we are gitignoring this file, they won't be pushed to github &mdash; 
keeping our API key information private.
